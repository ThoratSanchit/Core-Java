Definition:
Exception handling in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of the program.
It uses a combination of try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords.


Why Use Exception Handling?
Prevent Crashes: Ensures the program doesn't terminate unexpectedly.
Error Diagnosis: Helps identify the cause of the error.
Graceful Recovery: Allows the program to recover or provide meaningful feedback to the user.
