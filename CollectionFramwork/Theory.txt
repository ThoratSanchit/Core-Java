When to Use Which Collection?

1) ArrayList: When you need fast random access and don’t care about insertions/deletions in the middle.

2) LinkedList: When you need frequent insertions/deletions.

3) HashSet: When you need fast lookups and don’t care about order.

4) TreeSet: When you need sorted elements.

5) HashMap: When you need key-value pairs with fast lookups.

6) TreeMap: When you need sorted key-value pairs.
